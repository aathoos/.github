# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any Aathoos project, **please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, report it privately by:

1. Going to the affected repository on GitHub
2. Clicking **Security** → **Report a vulnerability** (GitHub's private advisory feature)

Or reach out to the maintainers directly through the contact information listed in the repository's README.

## Response

We take security reports seriously. You can expect:

- An acknowledgment within **72 hours**
- A status update within **7 days**
- A fix or mitigation plan communicated before any public disclosure

We follow **responsible disclosure** — please give us reasonable time to address the issue before making it public.
